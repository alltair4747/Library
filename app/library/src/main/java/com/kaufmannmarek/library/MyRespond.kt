/**
 * Creates an interface, which serves in case, when you need to call origin activity method, when the tasks in different class are done. To make this working, you must implement this abstract class in origin activity with method onRespondReceived. Set up the request code as you need. It serves as filter at the end of the process. Then you must pass this implementation to method of the class, where the other tasks are performed. Once the tasks are done and you got itÂ´s result, you must call setTaskResult, setTaskResultOK or setTaskResultBad. Afterwards the method onRespondReceived is called. You can implement this method as you need
